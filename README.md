# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

The purpose of this web-based app is to allow the user to be able to play a game similar to Frogger (or of a chicken attempting to cross the road) of which an icon character (.png) is moved from bottom to top, attempting to dodge
enemy bugs traversing horizontally across the highway.

## Installation

Simply put these files / folders in the same folder on computer or server:

* index.html
* style.css
* app5.js
* engine.js
* resources.js
* images folder

Open up the index.html from web-browser of choice.

## Instructions

Simply use the keyboard up, down, left and right arrows to move the icon image upwards towards the pool; and dodging the enemy bugs along the way. If user fails to dodge the enemy bugs sufficiently, the user icon image will be redirected at lower-center to restart the game. Game officially ends when user has navigated across the road completely; if so, the game will restart and the subsequent round (if desired) the enemy bugs will have different rates of speed, respectively.
